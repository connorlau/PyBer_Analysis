# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze a set of ride sharing data to determine discrepancies in ride volume, driver number, and fare between rural, suburban, and urban cities. Secondarily, this project is meant to produce a visual representation of changing ride volume over a period of time, for profibility analysis purposes. 

## Results

###### Differences in Ride Sharing Between City Types

Urban cities showed, on average, significantly higher ride volume, number of drivers, and fare total. Rural cities showed the smallest values in these categories while suburban cities were in the middle. 

However, rural cities had the greatest average fare per ride and per driver. Urban cities had the smallest average fare per ride and per driver, while suburban cities were once again in the middle. \
